# alpha_go_zero_implementation
An implementation of the Alpha Go Zero algorithm, runnable on a single GPU, released into the public domain.
I provide a semi-detailed overview along with instructions for compiling and running at http://arcanefortune.com/alpha_go_initial.php
An updated discussion of the code can be found at: http://arcanefortune.com/alpha_go_update.php

See "build.sh" and "build_centos.sh" for examples on how to compile the code. It can vary slightly with each platform. "build_centos8.sh" works
on Centos 8 as of Jan-23-2020. See the links above for more details on the setups I've compiled on.
